# Introducing the Map Hierarchy


1. **What is a HashMap?**
   - A **HashMap** stores **key-value pairs** where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.
   - The **key** is typically a simple object (like a string or number), while the **value** can be complex, such as an instance of a class (e.g., an `Invoice` object).

2. **How HashMap Works:**
   - You can use a **key** to retrieve its corresponding **value**.
   - Example: In an invoice application, invoice numbers could be the keys, and the invoice objects themselves would be the values.
   
3. **Important Concepts:**
   - A **key** represents a **value** and is **unique** in a HashMap (no two identical keys).
   - A **value** does not have to be unique, meaning the same value can be associated with different keys.
   - A key-value pair in a map is referred to as an **entry**.
   - You can retrieve a value by using its associated **key**.

4. **Map Interface and Its Hierarchy:**
   - The **Map interface** represents the basic concept of key-value pairs in Java Collections.
   - **SortedMap** and **NavigableMap** are extensions of Map that maintain the order of keys.
   - Common implementations of the **Map interface** include:
     - **HashMap** (widely used)
     - **LinkedHashMap** (maintains insertion order)
     - **IdentityHashMap** (compares keys by reference, not equality)

5. **Multimaps:**
   - **Multimap** is a concept where a single key can be associated with multiple values. 
   - This feature isn’t natively supported in the Collections Framework, but you can create similar structures (e.g., using a Map where the value is a List).

---

**Summary**: A **HashMap** is a key-value store where each key uniquely identifies a value. You can use it to store and retrieve data efficiently by using the key. There are different types of `Map` implementations in Java, including `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `IdentityHashMap`, each with different behaviors.


# Using the Convenience Factory Methods for Collections to Create Maps


1. **Immutable Maps in Java SE 9:**
   - Java SE 9 introduced factory methods to create **immutable maps** and **immutable entries** in the `Map` interface.

2. **Creating an Immutable Map with `Map.of()`:**
   - You can easily create a small map (with up to 10 key-value pairs) using the `Map.of()` method.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Map<Integer, String> map = 
         Map.of(
             1, "one", 
             2, "two",
             3, "three"
         );
     ```

3. **Creating a Map with More Than 10 Key-Value Pairs:**
   - For maps with more than 10 entries, use the `Map.ofEntries()` method to add key-value pairs.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Map.Entry<Integer, String> e1 = Map.entry(1, "one");
     Map.Entry<Integer, String> e2 = Map.entry(2, "two");
     Map.Entry<Integer, String> e3 = Map.entry(3, "three");

     Map<Integer, String> map = Map.ofEntries(e1, e2, e3);
     ```

4. **Improving Readability with Static Imports:**
   - You can use static imports to make the code more readable and concise.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Map<Integer, String> map3 = 
         Map.ofEntries(
             Map.entry(1, "one"),
             Map.entry(2, "two"),
             Map.entry(3, "three")
         );
     ```

5. **Restrictions on Immutable Maps and Entries:**
   - The maps and entries created using these methods are **immutable**, meaning you cannot modify them after creation.
   - **Null keys, null values, and duplicate keys** are not allowed and will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
   
---

**Summary**: Java SE 9 allows you to create **immutable maps** using `Map.of()` for small maps (up to 10 entries) and `Map.ofEntries()` for larger maps. These methods ensure that maps are immutable and prevent issues like null values or duplicate keys.


# Storing Key/Value Pairs in a Map


1. **Relationship Between Keys and Values:**
   - **One key** can be **bound to only one value**.
   - **A value** can be **bound to multiple keys**.

2. **Consequences for Map Content:**
   - The **set of keys** cannot have duplicates, so it behaves like a **Set**.
   - The **set of key-value pairs** also cannot have duplicates, behaving like a **Set**.
   - The **set of values** can have duplicates, meaning it behaves like a **Collection**.

3. **Operations on a Map:**
   - **Put** a key-value pair in the map (fails if the key already exists).
   - **Get** a value from the map using its key.
   - **Remove** a key-value pair from the map.
   - **Check if the map is empty**.
   - **Get the size** of the map (number of key-value pairs).
   - **Put all the content** of another map into this map.
   - **Clear** the content of the map.

4. **Map Interface Implementations:**
   - All these basic operations are implemented in the **Map interface**.

---

**Summary**: A map allows each **key** to map to only one **value**, but a **value** can be associated with multiple **keys**. Keys and key-value pairs are unique, while values can have duplicates. Operations such as adding, getting, removing, and checking size are provided by the **Map interface**.

# Exploring the Map interface


1. **Map Interface**: 
   - The `Map` interface is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs in Java. It allows you to store and retrieve data efficiently using keys.

2. **Choosing Keys Carefully**:
   - **Mutable Keys are Dangerous**: Avoid using keys that can change (mutable keys). If you change the key after adding it to a map, it can mess up how the map finds the value, because the key’s hash code could change.
   - **Why?**: If the key's hash code changes, the map may not be able to find the correct value anymore. This can cause data loss or incorrect results.

3. **Map.Entry Interface**:
   - The `Map.Entry` interface is used to represent a single key-value pair in a map. 
   - It defines these methods:
     - `getKey()`: Returns the key.
     - `getValue()`: Returns the value associated with the key.
     - `setValue(value)`: Allows you to change the value associated with the key.
   - **Important**: You cannot change the key in a `Map.Entry` object, as modifying the key could corrupt the map and cause issues.

### Visual Explanation:

Imagine a bookshelf where the **key** is the label (e.g., "Science Book") and the **value** is the actual book. 

- If you put a **"Science Book"** on the shelf with a label, it's easy to find. But if you suddenly change the label of "Science Book" while it’s on the shelf, you might not be able to find it again because the label (key) no longer points to the correct book (value). 
- This is what happens when you change a mutable key after adding it to a map: you risk losing track of the value.

**Diagram:**
- **Correct Scenario**: The key ("Science Book") points to the correct value (the book).
- **Incorrect Scenario**: Changing the label after it’s placed on the shelf messes up the retrieval process.

By avoiding mutable keys, you ensure your map works properly and avoids issues like this.
