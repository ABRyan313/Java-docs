<h1>What is ERD</h1>
* An **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** shows how different things (like people or items) are connected in a system or database.
* It helps developers plan how to build a database when making a new system.
* ERDs can also be used later to understand or fix an existing system.
* It uses symbols (like shapes and arrows) to show the structure clearly.

**Diagram (as mentioned):**

* An **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is built using a few basic parts:

  * **Entity** – a thing like a person, object, or concept (e.g., Student, Book)
  * **Relationship** – shows how entities are connected (e.g., Student *borrows* Book)
  * **Attribute** – details or properties about an entity (e.g., Student has Name, ID)

<h1>Entity</h1>

* An **Entity** is something you can store information about — like a **car**, **person**, or **event**.
* It acts like a **noun** and is shown as a **rectangle** with its name inside in an ERD.
* There are **two types of entities**:

  * **Strong Entity**: Has its own ID (called a primary key) and doesn’t need another entity to exist.

    * Example: A **Student** is a strong entity.
  * **Weak Entity**: Can’t exist alone and depends on a strong entity. It has a **foreign key**.

    * Example: **Enrollment** depends on a Student to exist.

<h1>Relationship</h1>

* A **** shows how two entities are connected in a database.
* It usually comes from a **verb** (like “enrols”, “registers”, or “completes”).
* In an ERD, it’s shown as a **line** between two entities, often with a label.
* There are **3 main types of relationships**:

  * **One to One**: One item is linked to one other item.

    * Example: One student has one ID card.
  * **One to Many**: One item is linked to many other items.

    * Example: One teacher teaches many students.
  * **Many to Many**: Many items on one side are linked to many on the other.

    * Example: Students enroll in many courses, and each course has many students.

<h1>Attribute</h1>  
**Key Points in Simple Terms:**

* An **Attribute** describes something about an entity (like a name or age).
* In ERDs, attributes are shown as **ovals** or written **inside the entity box**.

**Types of Attributes:**

* **Simple**: Can’t be broken down.

  * Example: First name.
* **Composite**: Can be split into parts.

  * Example: Full name → First, Middle, Last.
* **Derived**: Calculated from another value.

  * Example: Age → from Date of Birth.

**Attribute by Value Type:**

* **Single-Value**: Only one value per entity.

  * Example: A person’s ID.
* **Multi-Value**: Can have many values for one entity.

  * Example: Multiple phone numbers.

Let me know if there’s a diagram for this you'd like preserved and explained!

<h1>Cardinality</h1>
**Key Points in Simple Terms:**

* **Cardinality** shows how many times one entity can be linked to another in a relationship.
* It tells you the number of instances, like zero, one, or many.
* It can be shown as numbers or symbols depending on the diagram style.

Examples will come later for better understanding!

<h1>Natural language</h1>

Natural Language
When we are creating an ERD we often have an idea of what we want to capture. This can usually be expressed in words, or using "natural language".

Some examples are:

"Record students, courses they enrol in, and teachers who teach the course"
"Capture the customer orders, customer details, and where the orders are being sent"
"Capture patient data and the operations they had"
These sentences include a few different types of words, which can be used as a starting point for an ERD. They are represented in a few different ways:

Noun: a "thing", such as a student or customer. Represented as an entity.
Verb: an action, such as enrol or send. Represented as a relationship between two entities.
Adjective: a describing word, such as residential or advanced. Represented as an attribute on an entity.
This can help you translate a description of what you need to diagram into an actual diagram.

<h1>Symbols and notations</h1>
**Key Points in Simple Terms:**

* ERDs are made using boxes and lines, but there are different **standards** or **methods** for drawing them.
* These standards define which **symbols** and **notations** to use to show entities, relationships, and other parts clearly.
* Knowing these helps everyone understand the diagram the same way.

<h2>Crows Foot</h2>

**Key Points in Simple Terms:**

* **Crow’s Foot** is a popular style for drawing ERDs.
* It’s named because the symbol for “many” looks like a crow’s foot with three prongs.
* This style clearly shows how entities relate, especially for “many” relationships.
* It’s widely used and easy to understand.

<h1>Conceptual Data Model</h1>

* ERDs can be made at **three levels**:

  * **Conceptual** — shows main business things (entities) and their relationships without much detail.
  * **Logical** — more detailed; shows attributes and keys but not physical details.
  * **Physical** — shows how data is actually stored in the database (tables, columns).

* The **Conceptual model** focuses on big-picture objects (like students and courses) and how they connect, not on how they’re stored.

<h1>Logical Data Model</h1>

* The **Logical Data Model** adds more detail to the conceptual model.
* It includes **attributes** (details) for each entity.
* It may add more entities to fully represent the data you want to capture.
* Example: For students and courses, it shows things like student name, course code, etc.

<h1>Physical Data Model</h1>

* The **Physical Data Model** shows the most detail.
* It defines actual **tables** and **columns** used in the database.
* Includes details like **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **data types** for each column.
* Can be made by hand or generated by software tools from a real database.
* Example: Shows exactly how student and course data are stored in tables.

<h1>How to Create an Entity Relationship Diagram</h1>
**Key Points in Simple Terms:**


1. Write a sentence or two about what data you want to store.
2. List the main things (nouns/objects) you want to store data about.
3. List the details (attributes) you want to save for each object.
4. Describe how these objects relate to each other.
5. Draw the diagram showing all this.

<h1>Tips for Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram</h1>


* Choose the right detail level (conceptual, logical, or physical) depending on who will use it.
* Check that all entities and attributes cover everything you want to store.
* Give clear names to all entities and attributes.
* For big diagrams, use colors or split into smaller parts to stay organized.
* Keep your naming and symbols consistent throughout the diagram.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

* An **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** helps you understand and explain what a system needs.
* You can make it simple (conceptual), detailed (physical), or in between (logical).
* Different symbols and notations show entities, attributes, and relationships.
* To start, try drawing an ERD on paper or use software tools made for this.
