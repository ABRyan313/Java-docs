### 🌱 1. What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?

Normally, in your program, you create objects using `new` (e.g., `Car car = new Car();`). With **IoC**, you **let Spring create and manage** those objects for you.
* **Example:**
  Instead of writing:

  ```java
  Engine engine = new Engine();
  Car car = new Car(engine);
  ```

  You configure it, and Spring creates `Engine` and `Car` and links them.

### 🔌 2. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

It’s a way to give an object what it needs (its **dependencies**) from **outside**, instead of creating them **inside**.
* **Example:**
  A `Car` needs an `Engine`. Instead of `Car` creating the `Engine` itself, you pass it to the `Car`:

  ```java
  Car car = new Car(new Engine());
  ```

  Spring does this automatically using configuration.

### 🧠 3. What is a Bean?

A **bean** is just a **Java object** that Spring creates and manages for you.
* **Example:**
  If you tell Spring in a config file or class that `Car` is a bean, Spring will create a `Car` object and manage it.

### 📦 4. What is the IoC Container?

It's the **brain** of Spring that **creates**, **wires**, and **manages beans**.
* **Example:** When your app starts, the IoC container reads your configuration and builds all the objects your app needs.

### 🏗️ 5. `BeanFactory` vs `ApplicationContext`

* **BeanFactory**

A **basic** container that can create and manage objects.
  * **Use case:** Lightweight apps or tools.
* **ApplicationContext**

 A **full-featured** container with extras like event handling, AOP, internationalization.
  * **Use case:** Most real-world apps use this.
* **Example:**
  Think of:

  * `BeanFactory` like a simple factory
  * `ApplicationContext` like a smart factory that also speaks multiple languages, handles events, and offers extra services

---

### 🔗 6. Configuration Metadata

You tell Spring **what beans you need** and **how they depend on each other**, using XML or annotations.
* **Example:**

  ```xml
  <bean id="engine" class="Engine"/>
  <bean id="car" class="Car">
    <constructor-arg ref="engine"/>
  </bean>
  ```

  Or using annotations:

  ```java
  @Component
  public class Engine {}

  @Component
  public class Car {
      @Autowired
      Engine engine;
  }
  ```
