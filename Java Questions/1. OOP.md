## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Question 1: What is Object-Oriented Programming?
**Answer:** Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

### Question 2: What are the main principles of OOP?
**Answer:**

- **Encapsulation:** The binding (or wrapping) of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a ‘class’. It also means hiding data (i.e., private variables) from direct access.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details of an operation while exposing a simple interface.
- **Inheritance:** Allows a new class to inherit properties and methods of an existing class.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of different classes to provide a unique interface by exposing a method that can behave differently.

### Question 3: What is inheritance?
**Answer:** Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object-Oriented programming systems).

### Question 4: What is an interface?
**Answer:** An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields. The methods in interfaces are abstract by default.

### Question 5: Explain the difference between abstract classes and interfaces.
**Answer:**

- **Abstract Class:** Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. Abstract classes are used to provide a base for subclasses to extend and implement the abstract methods.
- **Interface:** Typically contains abstract methods only. Starting from Java 8, it can also contain default and static methods. Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.

### Question 6: What is polymorphism?
**Answer:** Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Most commonly, it is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

### Question 7: Explain method overriding.
**Answer:** Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes. The method that is overridden is called an overridden method.

### Question 8: What is the "super" keyword?
**Answer:** The `super` keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class objects. The keyword can be used to call superclass methods and to access the superclass constructor.

### Question 9: What are getters and setters in Java?
**Answer:** Getters and setters are methods that get and set the value of a private variable. For example:

```java
public class Data {
    private int num;
    public int getNum() {
        return num;
    }
    public void setNum(int num) {
        this.num = num;
    }
}
```

### Question 10: What is static in Java?
**Answer:** The keyword static means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type. This means that only one instance of that static member is created which is shared across all instances of the class.
