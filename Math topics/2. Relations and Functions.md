# 🧩 1️⃣ What Is a Relation?

A **relation** connects elements of one set to another set.
Formally, a **relation R from set A to set B** is **a subset of the Cartesian product** A × B.

### 💡 Meaning:

If
A = {1, 2, 3}
and
B = {x, y, z},
then
A × B = { (1,x), (1,y), (1,z), (2,x), (2,y), (2,z), (3,x), (3,y), (3,z) }

Now pick some pairs → that’s a relation.

Example:
R = { (1,x), (2,y), (3,z) }
✅ So R ⊆ A × B

# 🧠 2️⃣ Relation Representation

You can show relations in three main ways:

| Form                 | Example                   | Description            |                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| **Roster (tabular)** | R = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)} | Listing pairs          |                |
| **Set-builder**      | R = {(x,y)                | y = x + 1, x ∈ A}      | Defines a rule |
| **Arrow Diagram**    | 1→2, 2→3, 3→4             | Shows mapping visually |                |

# 🔁 3️⃣ Types of Relations (on the same set)

Now assume R is a **relation on A**, meaning both elements come from the same set (R ⊆ A × A).

Let’s explore the **five key properties** you’ll see in exams 👇

---

## 🔹 a) Reflexive Relation

Every element is related to itself.

**Definition:**
∀ a ∈ A, (a, a) ∈ R

**Example:**
A = {1, 2, 3}
R = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2)} → ✅ Reflexive
because all (a,a) pairs are present.

**Counterexample:**
R = {(1,1), (2,3)} → ❌ not reflexive (missing (2,2), (3,3))

---

## 🔹 b) Symmetric Relation

If a is related to b, then b is related to a.

**Definition:**
If (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R

**Example:**
A = {1, 2, 3}
R = {(1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)} ✅ symmetric
because every pair has its reverse.

---

## 🔹 c) Transitive Relation

If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c.

**Definition:**
If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R

**Example:**
A = {1,2,3}
R = {(1,2), (2,3), (1,3)} ✅ transitive
because (1,2) & (2,3) → (1,3) present.

---

## 🔹 d) Antisymmetric Relation

If (a, b) and (b, a) are both in R, then a = b.

**Definition:**
If (a,b) ∈ R and (b,a) ∈ R ⇒ a = b

**Example:**
R = {(1,1), (2,2), (1,2)} ✅ antisymmetric
(because there’s no (2,1))

---

## 🔹 e) Irreflexive Relation

No element is related to itself.

**Definition:**
∀ a ∈ A, (a, a) ∉ R

**Example:**
R = {(1,2), (2,3)} ✅ irreflexive

---

# 🧠 4️⃣ Special Types of Relations

| Type                       | Property                               | Example                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Equivalence Relation**   | Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive     | “is equal to”                  |
| **Partial Order Relation** | Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive | “is less than or equal to” (≤) |

---

### 💡 Examples:

* “Is brother of” → **symmetric**, not reflexive
* “Is parent of” → **antisymmetric**, not symmetric
* “Has same age as” → **equivalence relation**
* “Is ancestor of” → **transitive**

---

# 🧩 5️⃣ Number of Relations

If |A| = m and |B| = n,
then number of possible relations from A → B = **2^(m×n)**
(because each pair in A×B can either be included or not)

Example:
|A| = 2, |B| = 3
→ A×B = 6 pairs
→ Possible relations = 2⁶ = **64**

---

# 🔢 6️⃣ What Is a Function?

A **function** is a *special kind of relation* where:

✅ Every element in A is related to **exactly one** element in B.

Mathematically,
f : A → B
is a function if
for each a ∈ A, there exists **one and only one** b ∈ B such that (a,b) ∈ f.

---

## ✅ Example (Function)

A = {1,2,3}, B = {x,y,z}
f = {(1,x), (2,y), (3,z)} ✅ Function (each A has exactly one B)

❌ Not a function:
f = {(1,x), (1,y)} → 1 maps to two values.

---

# 🔣 7️⃣ Function Representation

| Representation    | Example             |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Arrow diagram** | 1→a, 2→b, 3→c       |
| **Equation form** | f(x) = x²           |
| **Table form**    | x: 1,2,3 → y: 1,4,9 |

# ⚙️ 8️⃣ Types of Functions

| Type                       | Definition                       | Example                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **One-to-One (Injective)** | No two A’s map to the same B     | f(x)=x+1                            |
| **Onto (Surjective)**      | Every B has at least one A       | f(x)=x², A={−2,−1,0,1,2}, B={0,1,4} |
| **Bijective**              | Both one-to-one & onto           | f(x)=x                              |
| **Many-to-One**            | Different A’s map to same B      | f(x)=x²                             |
| **Into Function**          | Not all elements of B are mapped | f(x)=x, A={1,2}, B={1,2,3}          |

---

# 🔄 9️⃣ Composition of Functions

If
f : A → B
and
g : B → C,

then
**(g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x))**

Example:
f(x) = x + 2
g(x) = 3x
(g ∘ f)(x) = 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6

---

# 🔙 🔁 🔛 10️⃣ Inverse Function

If f is **bijective**, it has an **inverse function** f⁻¹ : B → A
that reverses the mapping.

Example:
f(x) = 2x + 3
→ f⁻¹(x) = (x − 3)/2

Check: f(f⁻¹(x)) = x ✅

---

# 🧮 11️⃣ Domain, Codomain & Range

For f : A → B

* **Domain** → all input values (set A)
* **Codomain** → set B (all possible outputs)
* **Range** → actual outputs (subset of B)

Example:
f(x) = x², A = {−2,−1,0,1,2}, B = ℝ
→ Range = {0,1,4}

| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Subset of A×B   | Special relation where every A maps to one B |
| Uniqueness | Not required    | Must be unique                               |
| Example    | {(1,2),(1,3)} ✅ | {(1,2),(1,3)} ❌                              |
