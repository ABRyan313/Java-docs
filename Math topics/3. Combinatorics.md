## üßÆ 1. What is Combinatorics?

**Combinatorics** is the **mathematics of counting**.
It helps us find **how many ways** things can be arranged or selected ‚Äî
without listing them one by one.

## üß© 2. Key Branches

There are **two main types** you must master:

| Type            | Keyword                  | Meaning           | Example                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Permutation** | **Order matters**        | Arranging objects | How many ways can you arrange 3 letters A, B, C?     |
| **Combination** | **Order doesn‚Äôt matter** | Selecting objects | How many ways can you choose 2 letters from A, B, C? |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Permutations (Order matters)

### Formula:

[
nPr = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
]

Where:

* **n** = total number of items
* **r** = number of items to arrange
* **! (factorial)** = n! = n √ó (n‚àí1) √ó (n‚àí2) √ó ... √ó 1

---

### Example 1:

How many ways can we arrange 3 letters: A, B, C?

Here, n = 3, r = 3
[
3P3 = \frac{3!}{(3 - 3)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
]
‚úÖ Arrangements: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA

---

### Example 2:

How many 2-digit numbers can be formed using digits {1, 2, 3} (no repetition)?

Here, n = 3, r = 2
[
3P2 = \frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
]
‚úÖ Numbers: 12, 13, 21, 23, 31, 32

---

## üß∫ 4. Combinations (Order doesn‚Äôt matter)

### Formula:

[
nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
]

Where:

* **n** = total number of items
* **r** = number of items to choose

---

### Example 1:

How many ways to choose 2 letters from {A, B, C}?

[
3C2 = \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{2√ó1} = 3
]
‚úÖ Combinations: AB, AC, BC
(order doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Üí AB = BA)

---

### Example 2:

If you have 5 people, how many ways to form a 2-person team?

[
5C2 = \frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \frac{120}{2√ó6} = 10
]
‚úÖ So there are 10 possible pairs.

## üß† 5. When to Use Which

| Situation                                           | Type        | Example |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Arranging digits/letters/passwords                  | Permutation | 3P2     |
| Selecting members/teams/committees                  | Combination | 5C2     |
| Forming license plates with different order meaning | Permutation | 6P3     |
| Picking cards (order irrelevant)                    | Combination | 52C5    |

## üí° 6. Special Formulas

| Case                                     | Formula            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| If repetition **allowed** in arrangement | ( n^r )            |
| If all n items arranged                  | ( n! )             |
| Relation between nPr and nCr             | ( nPr = nCr √ó r! ) |
