## 🧠 1. What is Logic?

Logic is the **science of reasoning** — it helps us determine whether a statement is **true or false**.
It’s used in:

* Programming (conditions, loops, algorithms)
* Circuit design (AND, OR, NOT gates)
* AI, proofs, and query optimization

---

## 🧩 2. Proposition (Statement)

A **proposition** is a **declarative sentence** that is **either true or false**, but **not both**.

✅ Examples (Propositions):

* 2 + 2 = 4 → True
* Dhaka is in Bangladesh → True
* 5 is greater than 10 → False

❌ Not propositions:

* What time is it? (Question)
* Close the door. (Command)

## 🔢 3. Types of Propositions

| Type                | Example                         | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple (Atomic)** | “It is raining.”                | Cannot be broken into smaller parts                             |
| **Compound**        | “It is raining and it is cold.” | Formed by joining simple propositions using logical connectives |

## ⚙️ 4. Logical Connectives (Operators)

| Symbol | Name          | Meaning                   | Example                    | Result                           |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ¬p     | NOT           | Negation (opposite)       | If p = true → ¬p = false   | Inverts truth                    |
| p ∧ q  | AND           | True if both true         | p: True, q: False → False  | Both must be true                |
| p ∨ q  | OR            | True if at least one true | p: True, q: False → True   | Either true                      |
| p → q  | Implication   | “If p then q”             | If p=true, q=false → False | Only false when p=true & q=false |
| p ↔ q  | Biconditional | “p if and only if q”      | True when both same        | Same truth value                 |

## 🧮 5. Truth Tables

|  p  |  q  |  ¬p | p ∧ q | p ∨ q | p → q | p ↔ q |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  T  |  T  |  F  |   T   |   T   |   T   |   T   |
|  T  |  F  |  F  |   F   |   T   |   F   |   F   |
|  F  |  T  |  T  |   F   |   T   |   T   |   F   |
|  F  |  F  |  T  |   F   |   F   |   T   |   T   |

## 🧩 6. Important Terms

| Term              | Meaning                         | Example |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Tautology**     | Always true                     | p ∨ ¬p  |
| **Contradiction** | Always false                    | p ∧ ¬p  |
| **Contingency**   | Sometimes true, sometimes false | p → q   |

## 🧠 7. Logical Equivalences (Used in Simplification)

| Rule             | Formula                                        | Meaning                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Double Negation  | ¬(¬p) ≡ p                                      | Two negatives cancel                     |
| De Morgan’s Laws | ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p ∨ ¬q) <br> ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q) | Important for simplifying                |
| Implication      | p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q                                 | “If p then q” equals “Either not p or q” |
| Contrapositive   | p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p                                | Same truth value                         |
| Distributive     | p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)                | Like algebra                             |

## 🔍 8. Examples

### Example 1:

p: “I study.”
q: “I pass.”

Expression: **p → q**
Meaning: “If I study, then I pass.”
Only false if I study but fail.

---

### Example 2 (Simplify):

¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ?
By De Morgan’s Law → ¬p ∧ ¬q ✅

---

### Example 3:

(p → q) ∧ (q → r) → (p → r)
This is **transitivity** of implication (logical reasoning rule).
