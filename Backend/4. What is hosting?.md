# 🔌 What is a Web Server?

### Summary
A **web server** can refer to either:
- **Hardware**: A computer storing web server software and files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).
- **Software**: An HTTP server that processes URLs and delivers requested content.

Browsers request files via HTTP; the server responds with files or errors like **404 Not Found**.

## 🖥 Static vs Dynamic Web Servers

| Type        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static**  | Sends files as-is. Easiest setup.                                           |
| **Dynamic** | Uses app servers & databases to generate content before sending.            |

- Ex: MDN/Wikipedia use dynamic content with templates + large databases.

## 🔍 How a Web Server Works (Step-by-step)

### 1. Hosting Files
Web servers store:
- HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, fonts.

**Why not host on your own PC?**
- Limited uptime
- No static IP
- No 24/7 availability
- Lack of maintenance

**👉 Solution**: Use a hosting provider & upload files there.

### 2. Communicating via HTTP

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
- **Textual**: Commands are human-readable
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent

**Rules:**
- Clients send **requests**
- Servers send **responses**
- Every request must be answered (even if it’s an error)

### 📂 Request Flow (Diagram Preserved)
1. Browser requests URL
2. Server checks for file:
   - ✅ Found → Returns file
   - 🔄 Dynamic generation → Processes & returns
   - ❌ Not found → Returns 404 error page

**Example**: MDN custom 404 error page (Diagram Preserved)

## 📄 Static vs. Dynamic Content

| Static Sites                         | Dynamic Sites                        |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Easy to build                       | Requires app server + database       |
| Files are served as-is              | Content is processed/generated live  |
| Good for beginners                  | Flexible but complex setup           |

## 🧰 Application Servers (For Dynamic Sites)
- Used for blogs, e-commerce, wikis, etc.
- Many **off-the-shelf** solutions available
- Only rare cases need custom-built servers (e.g. embedded systems)
