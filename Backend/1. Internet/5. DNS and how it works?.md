# What is DNS?

DNS is like the Internet’s phonebook — it translates human-friendly domain names (like nytimes.com) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate.
Every internet-connected device has a unique IP address. DNS allows us to use simple domain names instead of memorizing complex IP addresses like 192.168.1.1 or long IPv6 addresses.

# How does DNS work?

### 🔹 **Article 1: What is DNS?**

- DNS stands for **Domain Name System** — it's like the phonebook of the Internet.
- Humans use **domain names** (like `google.com`) while machines use **IP addresses** (like `192.168.1.1`).
- DNS **translates domain names into IP addresses**, allowing browsers to load websites.
- Every device on the internet has a **unique IP address**.
- DNS makes the internet **user-friendly**, so we don’t have to memorize complex IPs (especially IPv6).

### 🔹 **Article 2: DNS Resolution Process**

- DNS resolution is the process of **converting a hostname (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address**.
- Like finding a house using a street address, DNS **locates internet devices** using their IP addresses.
- When a user types a domain into their browser, the system **automatically starts DNS resolution** to find the website’s IP.
- DNS queries travel through **multiple hardware components** (e.g., resolvers, servers).
- The entire process is **invisible to the user** — it happens behind the scenes after a web request is made.

# There are 4 DNS servers involved in loading a webpage:

### 🔹 **DNS Recursor**
- Think of it like a **librarian** you ask to find a book.
- It gets your request (e.g., a website name like `example.com`) and **starts searching** where to find it.
- It does the heavy lifting by asking other servers to get the final answer (IP address).

---

### 🔹 **Root Nameserver**
- Like the **library index**, it **points to the right section (rack)** where the book might be.
- It's the **first stop** the librarian goes to for help.

---

### 🔹 **TLD Nameserver**
- Like a **specific rack in the library** (e.g., the "com" section for `.com` websites).
- It helps **narrow down the search** by pointing to servers that know more about that specific domain type.

---

### 🔹 **Authoritative Nameserver**
- Like the **actual book or dictionary** on the shelf.
- It gives the **final answer**: the real IP address of the website.
- This info is sent back to the librarian (DNS recursor), who then tells your computer.

# What's the difference between an authoritative DNS server and a recursive DNS resolver?

### 🔹 **Authoritative DNS Server vs. Recursive DNS Resolver**

🧠 Think of the **Recursive Resolver** as the **detective** that goes out and gathers information, and the **Authoritative DNS Server** as the **final source** that actually knows the answer.

---

### 🔸 **Recursive DNS Resolver**
- It’s the **first stop** when your computer asks, “What’s the IP of this website?”
- It starts the **search process** and may ask several other servers to find the answer.
- Uses **caching** to save time—if it already looked up the same thing recently, it can respond faster without asking others again.
- **Lives at the beginning** of the DNS lookup chain.

📌 Example: Google DNS (8.8.8.8), OpenDNS, Comcast, etc., are all examples of recursive resolvers.

---

### 🔸 **Authoritative DNS Server**
- It’s the **last stop** in the DNS query process.
- It **knows the final answer**—the exact IP address linked to a domain (like cloudflare.com).
- Doesn’t need to ask anyone else; it has the **original DNS records**.
- **Lives at the end** of the DNS lookup chain.

📌 For **subdomains** like `blog.cloudflare.com`, it may point to another server (CNAME) that knows about just the blog part.

---

### 🔸 **Cloudflare's Role**
- Cloudflare doesn't just run basic DNS resolvers—they run **infrastructure-level authoritative servers**, including **part of the global root server system** (like the **F-root server**).
- Their **Anycast network** helps handle **huge amounts of DNS traffic** efficiently and without interruption.

📌 Cloudflare is a **key part of the Internet's backbone**, not just a DNS helper.

# What are the steps in a DNS lookup?

### 🔍 **What is a DNS Lookup?**
- It’s the process of **translating a website name** like `example.com` into an **IP address** that computers use to find each other.
- Think of it like **looking up someone's phone number** in a contact list.

---

### 🧠 **Caching Makes It Faster**
- Sometimes the computer already **remembers the answer** from before (cache), so it can **skip some steps**.
- If nothing is cached, it goes through **all 8 steps**.

---

### 🪜 **The 8 Steps of a Full DNS Lookup (When Nothing is Cached):**

1. **User types** `example.com` into the browser.  
   → The request goes to a **DNS recursive resolver** (a smart helper that looks for the answer).

2. The resolver asks the **root nameserver** (“Where do I go to find info about `.com`?”).

3. The root server replies with the **TLD server’s address** (like `.com`).

4. The resolver asks the **TLD server** for `example.com`.

5. The TLD server replies with the **authoritative nameserver** for `example.com`.

6. The resolver asks the **authoritative nameserver** for the **IP address** of `example.com`.

7. The authoritative nameserver responds with the **IP address**.

8. The resolver gives that **IP address back to the browser**.

### 🧭 **Then What Happens?**

9. The browser sends a **HTTP request** to that IP address to get the website data.

10. The **web server replies** with the webpage, and the browser shows it to the user.

# What is a DNS resolver?

### 🧩 **What is a DNS Resolver?**
- It’s the **first helper** your computer contacts when it wants to know the **IP address of a website**.
- It **starts the DNS lookup journey** by asking around until it finds the answer.

---

### 📌 **Role of the DNS Resolver:**
- It **talks to the client (browser)** first.
- Then it **handles the full search process**, asking other DNS servers for help until it finds the **correct IP address**.

---

### 🔄 **Recursive vs. Iterative Queries:**
- A **recursive query** means the resolver will keep asking others **on your behalf** until it gets the answer.
- An **iterative query** means it may be given directions like “ask that server next,” and it has to follow the trail.

---

### ❗ Important Distinction:
- **Recursive DNS query**: The **question** being asked.
- **Recursive DNS resolver**: The **computer/server** that accepts that question and **finds the answer**.

# What are the types of DNS queries?

### ✅ **1. Recursive Query**
- **What it is:** The client says, “Get me the answer no matter what.”
- **What happens:** The DNS resolver does **all the work**—it keeps asking around until it gets the final answer or an error.
- **Example:** Like asking a librarian to fetch you a book—you wait while they go to other rooms to find it.

---

### 🔁 **2. Iterative Query**
- **What it is:** The client says, “Tell me the best info you’ve got.”
- **What happens:** The DNS server responds with a **referral** (e.g., "I don’t know, but try asking that server").
- **Example:** Like asking a librarian and being told, “Go to that floor, they might have it.”

---

### 🧠 **3. Non-recursive Query**
- **What it is:** A quick query with a quick answer.
- **What happens:** The DNS server **already knows** the answer (either it owns it or has it cached), so it just replies.
- **Example:** Like asking a librarian and they instantly reply because the book is **right in front of them**.

# What is DNS caching? Where does DNS caching occur?

### 🔁 **Why DNS Caching Exists**
- **Goal:** Speed things up and reduce load by **reusing previously found answers**.
- **How it helps:** Makes websites load faster, uses less internet bandwidth, and lightens the load on servers.
- **Where it's used:** Caching can happen at **multiple levels**—from your browser to your internet provider.

---

### 🌐 **1. Browser DNS Caching**
- **What it does:** Your browser keeps a **temporary list of website addresses** (DNS records) you’ve visited recently.
- **Why:** So it can **quickly reuse** that info without asking again.
- **Bonus tip:** In Chrome, you can check it at: `chrome://net-internals/#dns`

---

### 🖥️ **2. OS-level DNS Caching**
- **What it is:** The **operating system** (like Windows or macOS) also stores DNS records in its own cache.
- **Who handles it:** A small program called the **stub resolver** (or DNS client).
- **How it works:** If the OS doesn’t find the DNS record locally, it **sends a query to the internet** (usually to your ISP).

---

### 🧠 **3. ISP Recursive Resolver Caching**
- **Role:** The DNS resolver at your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** also caches records.
- **Smart shortcuts:**
  - If it knows the **authoritative nameserver**, it asks that directly, skipping root and TLD servers.
  - If it knows the **TLD info** (.com), it skips root servers.
  - If it knows nothing, only then does it ask the **root server** (least likely).

---

📌 **TTL (Time-To-Live):**
- All cached DNS data has a **time limit** (TTL) after which it gets deleted or refreshed.
