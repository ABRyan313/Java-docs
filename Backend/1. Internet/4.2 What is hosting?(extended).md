## 🧭 Exploring the Web

### 📄 Web Page
- HTML-based document, loaded by a browser  
- May contain:
  - CSS (styles)
  - JS (scripts)
  - Media (images, audio, video)
- Each page has a unique **URL**


### 🌐 Website
- A **domain** containing multiple linked web pages  
- Entry point: **Homepage**


---

### 🖥 Web Server
- Hosts websites and their files
- Sends requested files to browsers

> Don't confuse **websites** with **web servers**. One server can host multiple websites.

---

### 🔍 Search Engine
- Helps find websites or pages by keyword
- Not the same as a browser!

| Browser (Software)   | Search Engine (Web Service)    |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Displays content      | Helps you find content          |
| Examples: Chrome      | Examples: Google, Bing          |

## ⚙️ How the Web Works (Simplified)

1. User enters URL → browser sends **HTTP request**
2. Server responds with requested files (HTML, media, etc.)
3. Browser:
   - Parses HTML
   - Fetches linked CSS/JS/images
   - Renders and displays page

## 🔎 Searching for Information

- **Syntax/reference**? → Search on **MDN**  
- **Coding problems**? → Try **StackOverflow**
- Use general search engines for broader topics
