# Overview

### ⚡ Why Speed Matters
- **Faster websites = better user experience.**
- People expect websites to **load quickly** and respond **smoothly** to interactions.

---

### 🕸️ 1. **Latency** – The Loading Delay
- **Latency = delay in data travel** over the internet (like signal delay).
- It’s the **biggest obstacle** in making pages load fast.
- Developers aim to **reduce this delay** or **hide it** to make pages *feel* fast.

---

### 🔁 2. **Browsers Are Mostly Single-Threaded**
- Browsers generally do **one task at a time** (like reading one book before starting another).
- This makes it hard to juggle loading and interacting at the same time.

---

### 🎯 Developer Goals:
- **Minimize what the browser has to do** all at once.
- Keep the **main thread free** for smooth interactions like:
  - Scrolling
  - Taps/clicks
  - Animations

---

### 💡 How to Improve Web Performance:
- Understand the **single-threaded nature** of browsers.
- Move heavy tasks **off the main thread** when possible.
- Optimize code to **load fast and respond instantly**.

# Navigation

Here are the **key takeaways** in simple terms:

---

### 🚶‍♂️ **Navigation = First Step to Load a Page**
- Navigation happens when a user **requests a webpage**, such as:
  - Typing a URL in the browser
  - Clicking a link
  - Submitting a form
  - Other actions

---

### 🕒 **Goal of Web Performance: Minimize Navigation Time**
- The aim is to **reduce the time it takes to load a page** during navigation.
- **Latency (delay)** and **bandwidth (data speed)** issues are the **main culprits** causing delays.

---

1. DNS lookup


### 🔍 **Step 1: Locating Web Page Assets**
- When visiting a site (e.g., https://example.com), the **browser needs to find where the HTML and assets** (images, fonts, scripts) are located.
- A **DNS lookup** is needed to get the **IP address** of the site’s server (e.g., 93.184.216.34).

---

### ⚡ **Caching DNS for Speed**
- After the first DNS lookup, the **IP address is cached** for quicker future access.
- **DNS lookups** are usually needed only **once per hostname** for a page load.

---

### 🌐 **Multiple DNS Lookups for Different Hostnames**
- If a page references **multiple hostnames** (fonts, images, scripts), each one requires a **separate DNS lookup**.

---

### 📱 **Mobile Networks Add Latency**
- On mobile, DNS lookups must pass through the **cell tower** and a **central phone company server** before reaching the internet.
- This added **distance** introduces **latency**, especially on **mobile networks**, impacting performance.

2. TCP handshake

Here are the **key takeaways** from this passage:

---

### 🌐 **TCP Three-Way Handshake**
- Once the **IP address** is known, the browser establishes a connection to the server using **TCP** via a **three-way handshake**.
  
---

### 🔄 **The SYN-SYN-ACK Process**
- The **three-way handshake** involves **three messages**:
  1. **SYN** (Initiates the connection request)
  2. **SYN-ACK** (Server acknowledges the request)
  3. **ACK** (Browser acknowledges and the connection is established)

---

### ⏳ **Impact on Request Time**
- This handshake process involves **three messages** exchanged before the actual data request is made, which adds **additional time** before data can be transferred.

---

3. TLS negotiation

Here are the **key takeaways** from this passage:

---

### 🔐 **HTTPS/TLS Handshake**
- For secure connections over **HTTPS**, a **TLS negotiation** is required.
  - The **TLS handshake** involves determining the encryption method, verifying the server, and ensuring the secure connection before data transfer begins.
  - This requires **five additional round trips** to the server, beyond the **DNS lookup** and **TCP handshake**.

---

### 🔄 **Steps in the TLS Handshake** 
- The **five steps** in the TLS handshake:
  1. **Client Hello**
  2. **Server Hello and Certificate**
  3. **Client Key Exchange**
  4. **Finished (Client and Server)**

---

### ⏳ **Impact of TLS on Page Load**
- While the **TLS handshake** introduces **additional latency** (8 round trips in total), the **security** provided is crucial, as it ensures that **data** is encrypted and protected from third-party interception.

---

### 🚀 **Page Load Request**
- After all these steps, the browser is **finally** ready to send the content request.

# Response

Here are the **key takeaways** from this passage:

---

### 🌐 **Initial HTTP Request**
- **Browser sends an HTTP GET request** for content (typically an HTML file).
- Server responds with relevant **response headers** and the content of the requested HTML.

---

### 📝 **Example HTML**
- An example of a simple HTML structure is provided, containing:
  - A title
  - Links to a stylesheet and JavaScript
  - An image and a link within the body of the page

---

### ⏱ **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**
- **TTFB** measures the time between the user's request and the receipt of the first byte of the response (usually HTML content).
- In the example, the **first byte** of data received is the HTML content, and the **first chunk** is typically **14KB**.
- Linked resources like CSS, JS, and images aren't fetched until the browser encounters them during parsing.

---

### 🚧 **Congestion Control / TCP Slow Start**
- **TCP packets** are split into segments, and the server must wait for **ACKs (Acknowledgments)** from the client after sending a certain number of packets.
- **TCP Slow Start** is a mechanism to gradually increase the transmission rate of data:
  - **Congestion Window (CWND)** starts with a small number of segments and increases as ACKs are received.
  - If ACKs are not received, CWND is halved to avoid congestion.
  
---

### ⚖ **Purpose of TCP Slow Start**
- **Balancing transmission**: TCP slow start helps prevent overwhelming the client or network by gradually increasing the data transmission rate based on available bandwidth and network conditions.

---

# Parsing

Here’s a breakdown of the process described in the passage, focusing on the key steps involved in web performance optimization, specifically during the browser’s **parsing** phase:

---

### 🌐 **1. Parsing the Data**
- **Parsing** turns the raw data into usable structures like the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSSOM (CSS Object Model).
- **DOM**: The internal representation of the HTML content. It’s built as the browser parses the HTML.
- **CSSOM**: A similar structure to the DOM, created from the CSS. It represents the styles and rules for the page.
- **Initial Render**: Even if the HTML file is large, the browser can begin rendering based on the first chunk (typically 14KB) it receives.

---

### 🛠 **2. Building the DOM Tree**
- **HTML Parsing**: The HTML is tokenized, and these tokens are used to construct the DOM tree.
  - **DOM nodes**: Elements, attributes, text inside tags, etc.
  - The tree reflects parent-child relationships between elements in the HTML.
  - The **root** node is the `<html>` element, and other nodes are nested within it.
- **Blocking Resources**:
  - **CSS and non-blocking resources** (like images) are fetched as the DOM is being built.
  - **Blocking Resources**:
    - **<script> tags** (without `async` or `defer` attributes) block further parsing of HTML.
    - JavaScript affects layout, so its loading blocks CSSOM and DOM processing.

---

### 🔄 **3. The Preload Scanner**
- **Preload Scanner**: Works in parallel with the DOM building process to request high-priority resources like CSS and JavaScript.
  - It fetches resources even before they are encountered by the main HTML parser.
  - It **reduces render blocking**, speeding up the process of getting required resources into place before needed.
  - **Async/Defer for Scripts**: Using the `async` or `defer` attributes allows scripts to load without blocking HTML parsing, improving performance.

---

### 📜 **4. Building the CSSOM Tree**
- **CSSOM Creation**: Similar to the DOM tree, the browser parses CSS rules into a structure it can understand and work with.
  - It recursively applies styles in a **cascading** manner, refining the rules as needed.
  - The CSSOM is generally **fast to build** but might block the rendering of other assets like JavaScript (which often interacts with CSS).

---

### 🛠 **5. JavaScript Compilation**
- As CSS is parsed, **JavaScript files** are also downloading and are either compiled or interpreted.
  - **JavaScript engines** convert the code into an **abstract syntax tree (AST)**, and some browsers compile it to **bytecode**.
  - This happens mostly on the **main thread**, but code running in **web workers** doesn't block the main thread.

---

### ♿ **6. Building the Accessibility Tree**
- The **Accessibility Tree (AOM)** is also built in parallel. It’s used by assistive devices like screen readers to understand the page structure.
- The **AOM** is a semantic version of the DOM and ensures accessibility until the content is available to these devices.

---

### 🏎 **Optimization Tips**
- **Prioritize Critical Assets**: Include the necessary CSS and HTML for rendering in the initial 14KB to minimize render blocking.
- **Optimize Resources**: Use async or defer for JavaScript files and ensure high-priority resources are preloaded.
- **Minimize DOM and CSSOM Construction Time**: Ensure clean, simple HTML and CSS to reduce parsing and rendering delays.

---

# Render

The **rendering process** involves several stages that turn the raw data (DOM, CSSOM) into a visual display on the user's screen. Here’s a summary of these steps:

---

### 1. **Style**  
- **Render Tree Construction**: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to build the **render tree**, which includes only visible elements (i.e., elements with `display: none` are excluded).
  - **Visibility**: Elements with `visibility: hidden` still take up space in the render tree, unlike `display: none`.
  - **Computed Styles**: Each node in the render tree receives its relevant computed styles based on CSS rules from the CSSOM.

### 2. **Layout**  
- **Determining Geometry**: The layout step computes the **size** and **position** of every visible node in the render tree.
  - **Reflow**: Reflow occurs if there are changes to the size or position of any element after the initial layout. For example, if an image’s dimensions are unknown at the start, a reflow will occur when those dimensions are determined.
  - **Box Model**: In this phase, everything on the page is treated as a **box** (including margins, padding, borders, and content). Layout determines how each box fits within the viewport size.

### 3. **Paint**  
- **Rasterization**: Once the layout phase is done, the browser **paints** the elements to the screen, which means it draws the visual representation of the nodes.
  - **First Meaningful Paint**: The moment when visible content first appears on the screen.
  - **Pixel Representation**: The browser translates layout into actual pixels, including visual properties like text, colors, borders, shadows, and images.
  - **Performance Considerations**: The entire process (including layout and paint) must be completed within **16.67ms** (for smooth animations and scrolling), especially on devices with high-resolution screens like tablets or smartphones.

### 4. **Compositing**  
- **Layering**: Complex elements (like images, videos, or elements with certain CSS properties such as `opacity` or `transform`) are painted onto their own layers, which can improve performance.
  - **GPU Acceleration**: Layers that require frequent updates (like animations) are offloaded to the **GPU** for faster painting and compositing.
  - **Repainting and Recomposition**: If the page layout changes (e.g., due to a reflow), the page will be repainted. If different layers overlap, compositing ensures that layers are stacked in the correct order, ensuring visual integrity.

---

### **Optimization Considerations**
- **Avoiding Unnecessary Reflows**: Define dimensions for images and other elements to avoid layout recalculations (reflows) when new content arrives.
- **Layer Management**: Using layers improves performance but can be costly in terms of memory usage. Only use layers when necessary.
- **GPU-accelerated Layers**: Some properties, like `transform`, `opacity`, and `will-change`, promote elements to their own layers, which improves the performance of animations and visual updates.

---

By understanding these phases—**style, layout, paint,** and **compositing**—you can better optimize web pages for faster rendering and smoother user experiences, particularly on mobile and low-bandwidth environments.

# Interactivity

The **Time to Interactive (TTI)** metric plays a crucial role in measuring the user experience on a web page, specifically when the page becomes fully interactive, i.e., when the page responds to user inputs (like scrolling or clicking) within **50ms**.

Here's a breakdown of what happens after the **paint** stage and why TTI matters:

---

### **1. The Main Thread and JavaScript Execution**
- After the page is painted, the browser isn't necessarily finished. If the page contains JavaScript, especially scripts that are **deferred** (i.e., set to run after the **onload** event), it can block further interactions.
- **JavaScript Execution**: When JavaScript executes, it runs on the main thread, which is also responsible for handling user interactions like scrolling, tapping, and mouse events. If JavaScript is running on the main thread, it occupies it, preventing the browser from responding to user actions.

### **2. Impact on User Experience**
- Even if the page content (like images or text) loads quickly, if the **JavaScript** is large or takes time to download, parse, and execute, the page can remain unresponsive.
  - **Example**: If a large script file (`another-script.js`, 2MB in size) takes time to load, the page may be **visually ready** (you can see the content), but interactions like scrolling or tapping might be **delayed or janky** because the main thread is still busy processing the script.

### **3. Time to Interactive (TTI)**
- **TTI** measures the time from when the user first requests the page (starting from the DNS lookup) until the page is interactive. It specifically looks for the **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**, which is when the first meaningful content appears on the screen, and continues until the page is fully interactive (ready to handle user interactions).
  - **Interactive State**: This is when the page can respond to user input in under **50ms**. If JavaScript is blocking the main thread, TTI increases, leading to a poor user experience.
  
### **4. Main Thread Blocking**
- When JavaScript is being downloaded, parsed, and executed, the main thread is blocked. During this time, it cannot respond to interactions like:
  - Scrolling
  - Touch events
  - Click events
  
This leads to a **janky experience**, where the page appears to load quickly but is unresponsive to user actions until the JavaScript execution is completed.

### **5. Example of Bad User Experience**
- The example you mentioned, where a JavaScript file occupies the main thread for **1.5 seconds**, demonstrates this issue. During this time, the page might look ready, but any attempts to interact with it (like clicking or scrolling) would be delayed and not smooth.

---

### **How to Improve TTI and User Interaction:**
- **Optimize JavaScript**: Reduce the size of JavaScript files and optimize them to execute quickly. Tools like **tree-shaking**, **code-splitting**, and **minification** can help with this.
- **Defer Non-Essential JavaScript**: Ensure that JavaScript that is not required for initial interactions is **deferred** or loaded asynchronously (`async` or `defer` attributes).
- **Break Long Tasks into Smaller Tasks**: Instead of loading and executing large scripts all at once, break them down into smaller chunks so that the main thread remains available for user interactions.
- **Web Workers**: Offload some of the JavaScript processing to **Web Workers** to free up the main thread for user interactions.

By optimizing JavaScript execution and minimizing the time the main thread is occupied, you can significantly reduce TTI and improve the user experience.
