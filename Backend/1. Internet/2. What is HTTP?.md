# 🔹 **An Overview of HTTP**

HTTP is a **client-server protocol** used to fetch resources like HTML, CSS, images, and scripts. Communication is done through **requests and responses**, usually over TCP.

- HTTP is a **stateless**, **application-layer** protocol.
- It's **extensible** and widely adopted.

📌 *(Keep your diagram: “A single Web document composed from multiple resources from different servers”)*

📌 *(Keep your diagram: “HTTP as an application layer protocol, on top of TCP (transport layer) and IP (network layer) and below the presentation layer”)*

# 🔹 **Components of HTTP-Based Systems**

HTTP systems typically involve:

- A **client** (user-agent/browser)
- One or more **proxies**
- The **server**

📌 *(Keep your diagram: “An HTTP request from a client forwarded by several proxies to a server and a response taking the same route back to the client”)*

---

# 🔹 **Client: The User-Agent**

- The **browser** initiates the first request and then additional ones for embedded resources.
- JavaScript allows **dynamic updates** via asynchronous requests (e.g., `fetch`, AJAX).

---

# 🔹 **The Web Server**

- Delivers web resources to the client.
- May use **load balancing**, **databases**, and **caches** behind the scenes.
- HTTP/1.1 introduced support for **virtual hosts** via the `Host` header.

---

# 🔹 **Proxies**

Proxies help with:

- **Caching**
- **Filtering**
- **Authentication**
- **Load balancing**
- **Monitoring**

Types:
- **Transparent**: No changes to data.
- **Non-transparent**: May modify requests or responses.

---

# 🔹 **Basic Aspects of HTTP**

- **Human-readable** in HTTP/1.x
- **Stateless** (doesn't store state between requests)
- Supports **sessions** using **cookies**
- **Extensible** via headers

---

# 🔹 **HTTP and Connections**

- HTTP uses **TCP** for transport.
- HTTP/1.0: New TCP connection per request.
- HTTP/1.1: **Persistent connections** and **pipelining**
- HTTP/2: Introduces **multiplexing**
- **QUIC** (HTTP/3): Uses **UDP** for improved performance.

---

# 🔹 **What Can Be Controlled by HTTP**

HTTP headers control:

- **Caching**
- **Access control (CORS)**
- **Authentication**
- **Proxy behavior**
- **Session management** (via cookies)

---

# 🔹 **HTTP Flow**

The lifecycle:

1. TCP connection established
2. HTTP request sent
3. Response received
4. Connection reused or closed

> 📌 **Pipelining (HTTP/1.1):** Multiple requests sent before replies arrive  
> 📌 **Multiplexing (HTTP/2):** Requests/responses interleaved over a single connection

---

# 🔹 **HTTP Messages**

Two types:
- **Request**: Sent by client  
- **Response**: Sent by server

📌 *Keep the diagram: “Overview of an HTTP GET request with headers”*

**Sample HTTP GET request:**
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html
Connection: keep-alive
```

📌 *Keep the diagram: “Overview of a 200 OK HTTP response to a GET request including response headers”*

**Sample HTTP 200 OK response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2025 14:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3056
Connection: keep-alive
```

> 💡 In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, messages are encoded differently (binary frames / QUIC streams), but their **semantics** stay the same.

---

# 🔹 **APIs Based on HTTP**

- `fetch()` API is modern and flexible (replaces `XMLHttpRequest`)
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events):** One-way updates from server to browser

---

# 🔹 **Conclusion**

HTTP is:

- **Simple**, **powerful**, and **flexible**
- **Debuggable** (can inspect traffic)
- Continuously evolving — HTTP/3 brings better performance with QUIC
