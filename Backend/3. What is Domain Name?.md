# 🔹 **What Is a Domain Name?**

A **domain name** is a human-readable address (like `google.com`) that maps to a website’s **IP address** (like `192.0.2.2`), allowing users to access websites via browsers.

> 🔁 This translation from domain name to IP address is called a **DNS lookup**.

# 🔹 **Who Manages Domain Names?**

- Managed by **domain registries**
- Registries delegate to **domain registrars**
- Users register names through registrars
- Over **300 million** domain names currently exist

# 🔹 **Domain Name vs. URL**

- **Domain Name**: Part of the address (e.g., `cloudflare.com`)
- **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator): Full address, including:
  - **Protocol**: `https`
  - **Domain name**: `cloudflare.com`
  - **Path**: `/learning/`

🧠 Example:
```
URL: https://cloudflare.com/learning/
        └──────────────┘
       Domain Name: cloudflare.com
```

# 🔹 **Parts of a Domain Name**

Domain names have components separated by dots, moving from **general to specific** (right to left):

1. **TLD (Top-Level Domain)**: `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.uk`, `.jp`
2. **2LD (Second-Level Domain)**: The name directly left of TLD
3. **3LD (Third-Level Domain)**: Optional prefix before 2LD

📌 Examples:

- `google.com`
  - TLD: `.com`
  - 2LD: `google`

- `google.co.uk`
  - TLD: `.uk`
  - 2LD: `.co`
  - 3LD: `google`

> 💡 `.co` in `.co.uk` is used for companies in the UK

# 🔹 **How to Keep a Domain Name Secure**

- Registrars must notify you before your domain expires
- Some **dishonest registrars** may buy expired domains and resell them at high prices
- Choose a **trusted registrar** (e.g., Cloudflare Registrar) to avoid such practices
