### **What’s an IP address?**
- An IP address is a numeric identifier for devices on the internet (e.g., 216.146.46.10 for vox.com).  
- The **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)** distributes IP addresses to prevent duplication.

---

### **What is IPv6?**
- **IPv4** supports ~4 billion addresses and is nearly exhausted.  
- **IPv6** allows for vastly more addresses (a 39-digit number).  
- Adoption was initially slow but grew as IPv4 ran out — Google’s IPv6 users went from 1% in 2013 to 6% in 2015.

### **How does wireless internet work?**
- Wireless internet includes **wifi** and **cellular**.  
- **Wifi** uses unlicensed spectrum and has short range due to power limits.  
- **Cellular networks** use licensed spectrum and are organized into service "cells" with towers.  
- Wireless spectrum is auctioned, generating billions in revenue.

### **What is the cloud?**
- **Cloud computing** means storing files and software on the internet rather than local machines.  
- Examples: Google Docs, Gmail, Dropbox, and iCloud.  
- Benefits: automatic updates, file accessibility from any device, less risk of data loss.  
- For businesses, services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer scalable, on-demand server access.

### **What is a packet?**
- A **packet** is a small unit of data sent over the internet.  
- It includes a **header** (routing info, checksum) and **data** (up to 64 KB).  
- Packets can be dropped if routers are congested; senders are responsible for re-sending them.

### **What is the World Wide Web?**
- The **Web**, created in 1991, uses hyperlinks and supports multimedia and interactive content.  
- It evolved into a major platform for businesses (e.g., Yahoo, Amazon).  
- Standards are managed by **W3C**, but browsers (Google, Mozilla, Apple, Microsoft) define practical standards.  
- The Web is just one part of the internet; others include email and BitTorrent.

### **What’s a web browser?**
- A **browser** lets users view websites.  
- **Mosaic** was the first major browser; **Netscape**, **Internet Explorer**, and later **Firefox**, **Safari**, and **Chrome** followed.  
- By 2015, **Chrome** had ~50% market share.

---

### **What is SSL?**
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** encrypts web traffic to protect privacy.  
- It's shown by a lock icon in browsers.  
- Initially used by banks, now common on major websites.  
- In 2015, **Firefox** began treating sites without SSL as insecure; **Google** considered doing the same.

---

### **What is the Domain Name System (DNS)?**
- **DNS** translates domain names (e.g., vox.com) into IP addresses.  
- It's hierarchical: e.g., .com → vox.com → mail.vox.com.  
- DNS security is critical; **DNSSEC** was created for encryption but has low adoption.

---

### **Who decides what domain names exist and who gets them?**
- Managed by **ICANN**, a California-based nonprofit.  
- Domain types:
  - **gTLDs** (e.g., .com, .edu, .org)
  - **ccTLDs** (country codes like .us, .uk, .cn)  
- In 2011, ICANN made it easier to create new gTLDs, potentially adding hundreds more.
