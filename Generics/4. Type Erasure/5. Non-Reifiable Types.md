### ðŸ”¹ **Recap: Type Erasure and Its Effects**

- **What's Type Erasure again?**  
  Itâ€™s the process where Java **removes generic type info** (like `<String>`, `<Integer>`) during compilation. This causes some **limitations and risks**, especially with *varargs* (variable-length argument) methods.

### ðŸ”¹ **Topics Covered**

This part of the content is an overview, listing whatâ€™s discussed:
- What non-reifiable types are  
- What heap pollution is  
- Why varargs with non-reifiable types can be risky  
- How to deal with those warnings

### ðŸ”¹ **What is a Reifiable Type?**

- A **reifiable type** is one where all the type info is still available when the program runs.
- Examples:  
  - Basic types like `int`, `double`  
  - Non-generic types  
  - Raw types (like just `List` instead of `List<String>`)  
  - Wildcards with no bound, like `List<?>`

### ðŸ”¹ **What is a Non-Reifiable Type?**

- A **non-reifiable type** loses some or all of its type info at runtime due to type erasure.
- Examples:  
  - `List<String>`  
  - `List<Number>`  
- **Problem:**  
  At runtime, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can't tell the difference between `List<String>` and `List<Number>`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Limitations of Non-Reifiable Types**

- Because their full type info is missing at runtime, **you can't do certain things** with them:
  - Can't use them in `instanceof` checks  
  - Can't put them directly into arrays
