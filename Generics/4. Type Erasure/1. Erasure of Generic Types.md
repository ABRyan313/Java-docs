### ðŸ”¹ **Introduction to Generics and Type Erasure**
- **Why Generics?**  
  Java introduced *generics* to catch more errors during code writing (compile time), not during running (runtime), and to allow more flexible code using *generic programming*.
  
- **What is Type Erasure?**  
  Java uses something called *type erasure* to remove the type details of generics before your code runs. This means:
  1. It replaces the generic types (like `<T>`) with real types like `Object` or a specific class.
  2. It adds automatic type casts where needed.
  3. It creates special methods (called *bridge methods*) to keep things working properly if you use inheritance with generics.
  4. No extra class files are created for each type â€” so your program doesnâ€™t get heavier.

### ðŸ”¹ **Unbounded Type Parameter Example**

#### Original Code with Generics:
```java
public class Node<T> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

#### After Type Erasure (T is unbounded):
```java
public class Node {

    private Object data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Object data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Object getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

- **Layman Summary:**  
  Since `T` doesn't say what kind of type it is, Java just treats it like a general `Object` when the program runs.

### ðŸ”¹ **Bounded Type Parameter Example**

#### Original Code with Bounded Generics:
```java
public class Node<T extends Comparable<T>> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

#### After Type Erasure (T is bounded):
```java
public class Node {

    private Comparable data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Comparable data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Comparable getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

- **Layman Summary:**  
  Since `T` is limited to types that implement `Comparable`, Java replaces it with `Comparable` after removing generic info.
