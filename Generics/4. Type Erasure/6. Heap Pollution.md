### ðŸ”¹ **What is Heap Pollution?**

- **Heap pollution** happens when a **generic variable** (like `List<String>`) points to an object of the **wrong type** (like a `List<Integer>`).  
- This breaks type safety â€” the main reason generics exist in the first place.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **When Does Heap Pollution Happen?**

- When you mix **raw types** and **generic types**  
  â†’ Example: Using `List` instead of `List<String>`, then casting it wrongly.

- When you do **unchecked casts**  
  â†’ For example: `(List<String>) someObject`, and the object isnâ€™t really a `List<String>`.

### ðŸ”¹ **What Are Unchecked Warnings?**

- These are **compiler warnings** that tell you:
  > "Hey, I can't guarantee this operation is safe!"

- They show up during compilation if you do something risky with generics.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **How to Avoid Heap Pollution**

- **Compile all your code together**  
  â†’ This helps the compiler catch more problems.

- **Fix all unchecked warnings**  
  â†’ If there are **no unchecked warnings**, then **no heap pollution** will happen.
