### ðŸ”¹ **Generic Method Type Erasure (Unbounded Type)**

#### Original Generic Method:
```java
// Counts the number of occurrences of elem in anArray.
//
public static <T> int count(T[] anArray, T elem) {
    int cnt = 0;
    for (T e : anArray)
        if (e.equals(elem))
            ++cnt;
    return cnt;
}
```

#### After Type Erasure (T is unbounded):
```java
public static int count(Object[] anArray, Object elem) {
    int cnt = 0;
    for (Object e : anArray)
        if (e.equals(elem))
            ++cnt;
    return cnt;
}
```

- **Layman Summary:**  
  Even in methods, when `T` isnâ€™t limited to a specific type, Java changes it to `Object` before the program runs. This allows you to use any type but makes the method handle them as general `Object`s behind the scenes.

### ðŸ”¹ **Generic Method with Bounded Type**

#### Example Classes:
```java
class Shape { /* ... */ }
class Circle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
class Rectangle extends Shape { /* ... */ }
```

#### Original Generic Method:
```java
public static <T extends Shape> void draw(T shape) { /* ... */ }
```

#### After Type Erasure (T is bounded):
```java
public static void draw(Shape shape) { /* ... */ }
```

- **Layman Summary:**  
  Here, `T` can only be something that is a `Shape` (like `Circle` or `Rectangle`). So Java just replaces `T` with `Shape` when the program runs.
