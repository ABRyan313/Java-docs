In Java, you cannot directly use primitive types like `int`, `char`, `double`, etc., as type parameters for generics. Java generics are designed to work with reference types (i.e., objects), not primitive types. When using generics, you must use their wrapper classes (also known as "boxed types") instead of the primitives.

Here’s why this is important:

### **Primitive Types vs. Wrapper Classes**
- **Primitive Types:** `int`, `char`, `double`, etc., are not objects and cannot be used as type parameters in generics.
- **Wrapper Classes:** Java provides wrapper classes for primitive types, such as:
  - `Integer` for `int`
  - `Character` for `char`
  - `Double` for `double`
  - `Boolean` for `boolean`
  
These wrapper classes are reference types and can be used as type parameters in generics.

### **Example**

You cannot do this:

```java
Pair<int, char> p = new Pair<>(8, 'a'); // Compile-time error
```

But you can use the wrapper classes:

```java
Pair<Integer, Character> p = new Pair<>(8, 'a'); // Correct
```

### **Autoboxing**

Java provides **autoboxing** and **unboxing** to automatically convert between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.

- **Autoboxing**: Converts a primitive type to its wrapper class automatically.
  - `int` → `Integer`
  - `char` → `Character`
  - `double` → `Double`
  
- **Unboxing**: Converts a wrapper class object back to its corresponding primitive type.
  - `Integer` → `int`
  - `Character` → `char`
  - `Double` → `double`

So when you write:

```java
Pair<Integer, Character> p = new Pair<>(8, 'a');
```

The compiler automatically converts `8` to `Integer.valueOf(8)` and `'a'` to `Character.valueOf('a')` (autoboxing).

### **Why Can't You Use Primitives?**

Generics rely on type erasure, meaning that the actual type information is erased during compilation and replaced with `Object`. If you tried to use a primitive type, it would not be able to work properly with the generic system, which expects reference types. For example, `int` is not a reference type, and trying to use it in a generic context could result in issues such as inconsistent behavior or inability to perform certain operations.

### **Summary**
- Generics in Java only work with reference types, so primitive types like `int` and `char` cannot be used as type parameters.
- Use the wrapper classes (e.g., `Integer`, `Character`) instead of primitives in generic types.
- Autoboxing allows you to work with primitives in a more seamless way by automatically converting between primitives and their wrapper classes.
