### **1. Cannot Create, Catch, or Throw Objects of Parameterized Types**

**Key takeaway**: **Java does not allow the creation, catching, or throwing of objects of parameterized types** like generics with type parameters, such as `T` or `E`, in the following scenarios:

---

### **2. Extending Throwable Class with Generics**

```java
// Extends Throwable indirectly
class MathException<T> extends Exception { /* ... */ }    // compile-time error

// Extends Throwable directly
class QueueFullException<T> extends Throwable { /* ... */ // compile-time error
```

**Key takeaway**: A **generic class cannot extend `Throwable`** (either directly or indirectly). This is because Javaâ€™s exception handling system expects specific, concrete exception types, and generics are erased at runtime.

---

### **3. Catching Objects of Parameterized Types**

```java
public static <T extends Exception, J> void execute(List<J> jobs) {
    try {
        for (J job : jobs)
            // ...
    } catch (T e) {   // compile-time error
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Key takeaway**: You **cannot catch instances of parameterized types** (like `T` in the example). The catch block must reference a **specific exception type** at compile-time, not a generic type parameter.

---

### **4. Throwing Objects of Parameterized Types in Throws Clause**

```java
class Parser<T extends Exception> {
    public void parse(File file) throws T {     // OK
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Key takeaway**: You **can** use a **type parameter** in the **throws clause**, indicating that a method can throw an exception of a type that extends `Exception`. This is allowed because the actual type will be determined at runtime.

---

**Summary**: Java **does not allow parameterized types** for exceptions in `throw`, `catch`, or inheritance from `Throwable`. This restriction ensures that exceptions remain concrete and predictable at runtime. However, you can still declare that a method **throws a generic exception type**.
