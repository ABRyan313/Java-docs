### **1. The Problem**

```java
public class MobileDevice<T> {
    private static T os; // compile-time error
}
```
**Key takeaway**: You **cannot have a static field** with a generic type parameter like `T`. This is because static fields are shared among all instances, and `T` changes based on the object type, causing issues.

### **2. Why It’s a Problem**

```java
MobileDevice<Smartphone> phone = new MobileDevice<>();
MobileDevice<Pager> pager = new MobileDevice<>();
MobileDevice<TabletPC> pc = new MobileDevice<>();
```

**Key takeaway**: If you allow static fields with generic types, you face a problem. **Which type should the static field `os` be?** It can’t be `Smartphone`, `Pager`, and `TabletPC` at the same time, leading to confusion and errors.

### **3. Conclusion**

**Key takeaway**: Since static fields are shared across all instances, Java doesn't allow them to be based on generic types. This avoids conflicts where the field can't determine which type it should hold.

---

So in simple terms, **you can’t have static fields with generic types** because it causes confusion about which type the static field should represent when different objects use different types.
