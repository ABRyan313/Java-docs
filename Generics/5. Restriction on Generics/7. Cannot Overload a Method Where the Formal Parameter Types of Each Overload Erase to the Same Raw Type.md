### 🚫 **Cannot Overload Methods That Look the Same After Generics Are Removed (Type Erasure)**

```java
public class Example {
    public void print(Set<String> strSet) { }
    public void print(Set<Integer> intSet) { }
}
```

### ❌ Why This Fails:
When Java compiles generic code, it uses a process called **type erasure** — it **removes all the generic type information** (like `<String>` or `<Integer>`) to maintain backward compatibility.

So both of the methods above would look like this after erasure:

```java
public void print(Set set) { }
```

Now Java sees **two methods with the same name and same parameter type** — which is **not allowed** because it's ambiguous.

---

### ✅ Key takeaway:
You **can’t overload methods** if their generic parameters **erase to the same raw type** — because after compilation, they would **conflict and cause a compile-time error**.

If you need different behavior based on types, consider:
- Using different method names
- Or using method logic with `instanceof` and casting (carefully)
